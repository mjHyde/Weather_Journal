# Weather_Journal
Project #3 for Udacity's Front End Web Developer NanoDegree

--Practice w/ API and ASYNC Functions--

## Description
>Started with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JS** code for the *client* side and *server* side of the project. The main focus was to build ***POST/GET*** routes to work between the client and server side to transport client data, save it, then send it back to automatically update the weatehr journal UI. I went the extra step to customize it and make it a bit more useful to the data. I wanted to give it a backcountry ski community theme were you will log your findings in certain areas in the mountains.

## Usage
```
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI for a Weather-Journal App. It will date in certain data points to use the OpenWeatherApp API to POST data and then use our own server to saved client data and upload to UI. 
```

## Acknowledgment
>Thanks **Udacity* for the challenging project that helped me get a better understanding of *API and ASYNC Functions*.
